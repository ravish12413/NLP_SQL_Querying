LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

One of the most common types of databases that we can build Q&A systems for are SQL databases. LangChain comes with a number of built-in chains and agents that are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite). They enable use cases such as:

-Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions, -Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data, -Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze, -generate Your own openAi API secret Key. -Same way generate SERPAPI key.(this will let you browse search engine). create database
